## Ploomber Pipeline
We have implemented a Ploomber pipeline to run all the analysis files sequentially to improve reproducibility of the analysis and results

Command for running the ploomber pipeline:

    ploomber build

- The pre-run results of the jupyter notebooks from the ploomber pipeline are in the `output` directory
